Cupdraw 0.1

Cupdraw is a Object-J framework for creating graphical editors that is based on the concepts of the famous Hotdraw of Smalltalk.
So far, this version contains the main concepts of that Hotdraw with a few utility classes that can help you build a basic editor.

We hope to complete a basic documentation soon so stay tunned!
